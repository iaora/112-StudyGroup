This repo contains weekly problems that we do throughout the semester. It also contains general information about the course and additional resources.

Feel free to add/message me on [Facebook](www.facebook.com/jamiee.liao) or email me at **j.liao5079@gmail.com** with any questions about the course, future courses, or anything in general :)
